Project 2(Find the runner-up score) :- 
Given the participant's score sheet for your University Sports Day, you are required to find the runner-up score. You have scores. Store them in a list and find the score of the runner-up.
Sample input: [2, 3, 6, 6, 5]
Sample output: 5
Explanation: Given list is [2, 3, 6, 6, 5]. The maximum score is 6, second maximum is 5. Hence, we print 5 as the runner-up score.

"""
Project 3(Find the percentage) :-
You have a record of n students. Each record contains the student's name, and their percent marks in Math, Physics and Chemistry.The marks can be floating values. You are required to save the record in a dictionary data type.Student's name is the key. Marks stored in a list is the value. The user enters a student's name.Output the average percentage marks obtained by that student.
Formula: (sum of marks) / (no of subjects)
Sample input: { "Krishna" : [67, 68, 69],"Arjun" : [70, 98, 63],"Malika" : [52, 56,60] }
Sample output: Enter a name: Malika
Average percentage mark: 56
Explanation: Mark for Malika are [52, 56, 60] whose average is (52 + 56 + 60) / 3 => 56

Project 4(Find the name) :-
Given a string of n words, help Alex to find out how many times his name
